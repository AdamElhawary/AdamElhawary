Back story :- 

 I used to be a call center team manager, service matter expert working for Expedia.ca, Vodafone.UK and even optimum.US . I felt something was wrong! this is not what I really wanna do! I started to look around and I got to nothing. 
Then I faced an issue trying to complete a task on a specific website. I wanted to do it faster ! I created a Chrome Extension after learning Js/Html/Css. 
Now I'm a Web Developer, It's my job, My passion.
